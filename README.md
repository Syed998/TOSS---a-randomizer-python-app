# TOSS - a randomizer python app
This is an app that lets you get a random choice from a list.

**This requires that you have python-kivy installed**
A quick search on youtube and google with show you 
how to install it in your computer.

FILE DIRECTORIES:
main.py - The main file that runs the app
layout.kv - as the name implies it's the layout of the app.
buildozer.spec - basically required for making android apks.

Again the buildozer thing can be understood with a quick search on Youtube.
